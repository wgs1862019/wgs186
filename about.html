                      </h3>
			<p class="is-center coursedescription">
			The course will introduce students to articulations of racial blackness that destabalize binary notions of gender and sexuality. It will ask how discourses or modernity and humanism have excluded black persons from human recognitions and protections, including human markers of identity and difference like gender and sexuality. Students will thus ask how black lives can matter, if at all, and will further deliberate how black lives might be sexed abd/or gendered, in ways that do not re/produce the heteronormative, binary model of Western metaphysical thought. Media representations that reproduce racial spectacle and cultivate antiblack viscera, guts, and instincts in viewer-consumers to authorize anti-violence, for example, on the streets of Baltimore and Ferguson, will anchor and sustain class discussions, so that wemight disarticulate those 'scenes of sunjection.'The Black Lives Matter movement is hence rephrased in this class as a question for feminism about black reproductive futurity and the limits of Western metaphysical philosophy. Some of the questions we will consider inslude: Do black lives matter? Can life matter if it is black? How is black life gendered and/or sexed (in the second instance) if human recognition for black persons (in the first instance)?

                      	<p class="is-center aboutprofessors">
                          M. Shadee Malaklou is a critical race and gender and sexuality studies scholar with expertise in Frantz Fanon’s Black Skin, White Masks (1952). Her research on humanist, anti-black time interrogates the metaphysical relationship between space, time, and ontological (im)possibility to argue that gender and sexuality are produced as identity and type (that is to say, as uniquely human assemblages) through antiblack racism, more to the point, through the exclusion of black people from humanist space-time. This research contributes significantly not just to the study of racial blackness but also to how we understand the operations of non-black differences, including non-black racializations as well as sex and gender differences. In addition to writing for academic journals, she regularly publishes think pieces, most recently, in The Feminist Wire and CounterPunch, and contributes to Always Already: A Critical Theory Podcast as the Frantz Fanon correspondent. Prior to joining Berea College in Fall 2019 as Chair and Assistant Professor of Women’s and Gender Studies and Director of the Women’s and Gender Center, Malaklou served as Assistant Professor (2016-2019) and Acting Chair (2018-2019) of Critical Identity Studies at Beloit College, where she was also a Mellon Faculty Fellow for the Associated Colleges of the Midwest (2016-2018). Malaklou received her PhD in Culture and Theory and graduate certificates in Critical Theory and Gender and Sexuality Studies from the University of California, Irvine in June 2016.
